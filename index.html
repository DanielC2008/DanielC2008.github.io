           Hi! My name is <b>Daniel Chapdelaine</b> and I am a bit of a rarity around these parts. I am in fact a <b>native Nashvillian</b> ! Well, technically I am from a small town called Fairview that is 40 miles west of here, but I think it's close enough! I moved from Fairview to Nashville in 2008 to attend <b>Belmont University</b> and since graduating in 2012 I have struggled to find where I belong in the work force. I have worked in many fields including healthcare, food service, event planning, construction, and sales. I have learned an incredible amount from each one of these endeavors but none have inspired me as much as <b>software development</b>!
           <div class="space"></div>
					In January of 2016 I learned that Nashville was looking for dedicated <b>problem solvers</b>! Specifically, problem solvers who had the drive go from passive software user to dynamic software pioneer. It sounded like a challenge to me, and I am terrible at passing up a challenge. So, in May I joined <b>Nashville Software School</b> and immediately I realized that this new world is where I belonged. It was like walking into an alternate universe where my coworkers actually cared about the process as much as the result and many were like me... completely unsatisfied until the answer was uncovered. This concept is evident in many aspects of my life such as video games, sports, research papers, questions about physics, politics, and even teaching. <b>Teaching</b> has always been like a game to me. To be an effective teacher, one must decipher how their student learns, else one is simply regurgitating facts. Incessant question answering was my first clue that I could survive in a world that is, at its base, about finding <b>new solutions to old problems</b>.
					<div class="space"></div>
					I am so excited my new <b>career</b> encourages me to be a life long learner, simultaneously demanding that I learn at all costs and teach when I can! This new challenge is not just a six month endeavor like NSS, it is not just a job that fails to motivate once I've reached a certain level, it is an ever evolving maze requiring <b>flexibility, focus, and dedication</b>. Some people feel it is an never ending and impossible challenge. But like I said, I am terrible at passing up a challenge.
